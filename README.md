# üé∂ Emotion-Based Background Music Selector

This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects user emotions in real-time and selects background music tailored to their mood. Using facial emotion recognition and music recommendations, it brings a personalized, interactive music experience to users. Ideal for improving focus, relaxation, and enjoyment based on the user's emotional state.

## üîó Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Uses a webcam to capture facial expressions, which are analyzed by a deep learning model.
- **Music Recommendations**: Suggests background music that aligns with the detected emotions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically updates music suggestions based on changing emotions.
- **Simple User Interface**: Easy-to-use design that makes real-time feedback and control intuitive.

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
     ```
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

4. **Frontend Setup**:
   - **Navigate to Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - **Install Dependencies**:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
